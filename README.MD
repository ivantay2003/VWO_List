# Saving VWO List to CSV using BeautifulSoup #
<br><br><br>

__Repro Remote__ <br>
git remote add origin https://github.com/ivantay2003/VWO_List.git

__Problem Description__<br>
I need a list VWO (Volunteer Welfare Organisations) names and their url as I want to contact them. It took me a day of input the data manually base on the [NCSS site](https://www.ncss.gov.sg/GatewayPages/Social-Service-Organisations/Membership/List-of-NCSS-Members) into a CSV file, so that I can contact the VWO offline.
<br><br><br>
I decided to write a script to extract the names and url. The script was done within 20 minutes. In my haste I miss out that NCSS have kindly provided the download link for the file (one of the links). A mistake that I should not have spend whole day copying names manually one line at a time. :(
<br><br><br>
You can use this knowledge to extract data from most static pages. Most data analysis and many companies do this (but in a much more efficient and bigger scale manner).
